        ECCOLA is easy to apply in practice. It is a sprint-by-sprint evolving
        process that empowers ethical thinking in the product development
        process.
        As a result, ethical development is enhanced and Work Product
        Sheets (WPS) are created. The WPSs help you measure the Trustworthiness
        of the product. ECCOLA is an evolving set of cards and you choose the
        parts that are relevant to your work.

          a retrospective afterwards. Think about what worked & what did not.
